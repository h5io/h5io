`h5io <http://h5io.github.io>`_
=======================================================

h5io is a package designed to facilitate saving some standard Python
objects into the forward-compatible HDF5 format. It is a higher-level
package than ``h5py``.

API
^^^
h5io lets you quickly read, write, and list the contents of an HDF5 file.
Check out an example notebook here_.
